# Zero-Knowledge Engine – Concept

The ZK engine is responsible for:

- Accepting **minimal, structured input** from rehabilitation systems
- Validating that input against:
  - agreed-upon protocols
  - expected timelines
  - safety and plausibility constraints
- Producing **zero-knowledge proofs** that:
  - confirm progress or protocol adherence
  - can be verified by independent parties
  - do *not* expose underlying health data

This document is a conceptual placeholder for future collaboration with ZK specialists.
