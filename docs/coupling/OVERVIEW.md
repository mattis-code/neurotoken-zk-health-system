# Economic Coupling Layer v1.0

This module unifies BHBR and BHT into a deterministic  
economic state snapshot.

It does NOT expose:
- proprietary reward logic
- ZK-evaluated mint rules
- stabilization algorithms

It only exposes:
- reserve balance
- token supply
- unified integrity hash
- timestamp

This is regulator-ready and investor-friendly.
