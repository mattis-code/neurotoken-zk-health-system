# Security, Privacy & Compliance Principles

Guiding principles:

1. **Privacy by design**
   - Raw patient data never stored on-chain
   - Data minimisation and strict purpose limitation

2. **Separation of domains**
   - Clinical environments remain under healthcare governance
   - Token and settlement infrastructure is strictly separated

3. **Regulatory alignment**
   - GDPR, medical secrecy and professional ethics
   - Future EU AI Act requirements for high-risk systems
   - MiCA and other financial regulation for any token-related components

4. **Auditability**
   - Clear logs of who did what and under which policy
   - External audits before any large-scale deployment
