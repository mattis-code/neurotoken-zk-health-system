# Draft Token Model

The NeuroToken ZK Health System™ is designed to be compatible with a dual-layer model:

- **Brain Health Bitcoin Reserve™ (BHBR)** – conservative reserve layer  
- **Brain Health Token™ (BHT)** – programmable utility and incentive layer

Nothing in this repo represents a final token design, issuance schedule or legal commitment.  
The current draft focuses on:

- Mapping progress metrics to *points* or *claims* rather than direct token issuance
- Allowing off-chain accounting to be mirrored, fully or partially, in an on-chain environment
- Ensuring that any eventual tokenisation path is aligned with:
  - EU MiCA
  - anti-money-laundering regulations
  - consumer and investor protection rules
