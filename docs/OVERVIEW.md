# NeuroToken ZK Health System™ – Overview

The NeuroToken ZK Health System™ is a conceptual framework for connecting:

- **Rehabilitation progress** (off-chain, privacy-preserving)
- **Zero-knowledge verification** of outcomes and protocol adherence
- **Incentive and funding mechanisms** through a token-based settlement layer

Key objectives:

1. Reward real, measurable rehabilitation progress without exposing raw medical data  
2. Align patients, families, clinicians, payers and public services around the same KPI-framework  
3. Make long-term neuro-rehabilitation financially sustainable through outcome-oriented incentives

This document gives the high-level narrative and is intended for non-technical stakeholders.
