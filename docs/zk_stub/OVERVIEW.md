# ZK Progress Stub v1.0 (Public-Safe)

This stub implements the *interaction surface* for the
future zero-knowledge progress evaluator.

It does NOT include:
- proprietary rehabilitation metrics
- ZK proof circuits
- reward rules
- algorithmic weighting
- stabilisation mechanics

It ONLY provides:
- public development interface
- predictable placeholder outputs
- integrity snapshot hook

This keeps the repo safe while allowing developers to build
the surrounding system architecture.
