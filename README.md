Layers:

1. **Data & Events (off-chain)**
   - Clinical and non-clinical events captured in compliant environments
   - Data remains under control of health providers and/or platform operators
   - Only aggregated, minimised metrics leave the core health systems

2. **ZK Engine**
   - Translates progress metrics and protocol adherence into zero-knowledge proofs
   - Verifies that conditions for incentives are met without revealing underlying health data
   - Can run in secure enclaves or dedicated ZK services

3. **Token & Settlement Layer**
   - Separate from clinical systems
   - Can be configured to:
     - unlock funding tranches
     - allocate rewards to patients / families / communities
     - support philanthropic or public co-funding pools

4. **Governance & Policy Layer**
   - Defines who can onboard, verify and audit
   - Keeps the system aligned with medical ethics, financial regulation and data protection law

# Disclaimer

- This repository is **conceptual documentation only**.  
- It does **not** constitute:
  - investment advice  
  - a public offering of tokens or securities  
  - medical advice or a clinical protocol  

Any implementation must be evaluated against:

- Applicable health legislation  
- Data protection rules (GDPR and local implementations)  
- Financial and securities regulation  
- Ethical standards for clinical research and digital health solutions

# Governance & Roles

The NeuroToken ZK Health System™ requires multi-layer governance:

- **Lionking BioTech™ / Lionking Holding AS**
  - IP ownership and long-term vision
  - Coordination of research, pilots and partnerships

- **Clinical & rehabilitation partners**
  - Control over clinical processes and patient relationships
  - Responsibility for medical quality and ethical approval

- **Technical partners (AI, ZK, infrastructure)**
  - Implement, harden and maintain the technical stack
  - Participate in security and privacy reviews

- **Advisory board**
  - Combine legal, medical, cryptography and patient-representative perspectives

# NeuroToken ZK Health System™ – Overview

The NeuroToken ZK Health System™ is a conceptual framework for connecting:

- **Rehabilitation progress** (off-chain, privacy-preserving)
- **Zero-knowledge verification** of outcomes and protocol adherence
- **Incentive and funding mechanisms** through a token-based settlement layer

Key objectives:

1. Reward real, measurable rehabilitation progress without exposing raw medical data  
2. Align patients, families, clinicians, payers and public services around the same KPI-framework  
3. Make long-term neuro-rehabilitation financially sustainable through outcome-oriented incentives

This document gives the high-level narrative and is intended for non-technical stakeholders.

# Roadmap 2025–2030 (Draft)

- **2025**
  - Concept consolidation and patent filings
  - Initial legal and regulatory analysis
  - Early partner conversations (healthcare, ZK, crypto infra)

- **2026**
  - Prototype designs and simulation tools (no live patients)
  - Alignment with Hjernensprer.no and BrainSays.com pilots
  - Refinement of token and incentive models

- **2027–2028**
  - Controlled pilots with synthetic or heavily anonymised data
  - External audits and ethical reviews
  - Preparation of public-facing whitepaper and governance framework

- **2029–2030**
  - Scaling strategy subject to regulatory green light and partner readiness
  - Potential separation between foundation, operating entities and infrastructure providers

# Security, Privacy & Compliance Principles

Guiding principles:

1. **Privacy by design**
   - Raw patient data never stored on-chain
   - Data minimisation and strict purpose limitation

2. **Separation of domains**
   - Clinical environments remain under healthcare governance
   - Token and settlement infrastructure is strictly separated

3. **Regulatory alignment**
   - GDPR, medical secrecy and professional ethics
   - Future EU AI Act requirements for high-risk systems
   - MiCA and other financial regulation for any token-related components

4. **Auditability**
   - Clear logs of who did what and under which policy
   - External audits before any large-scale deployment

# Draft Token Model

The NeuroToken ZK Health System™ is designed to be compatible with a dual-layer model:

- **Brain Health Bitcoin Reserve™ (BHBR)** – conservative reserve layer  
- **Brain Health Token™ (BHT)** – programmable utility and incentive layer

Nothing in this repo represents a final token design, issuance schedule or legal commitment.  
The current draft focuses on:

- Mapping progress metrics to *points* or *claims* rather than direct token issuance
- Allowing off-chain accounting to be mirrored, fully or partially, in an on-chain environment
- Ensuring that any eventual tokenisation path is aligned with:
  - EU MiCA
  - anti-money-laundering regulations
  - consumer and investor protection rules

# Zero-Knowledge Engine – Concept

The ZK engine is responsible for:

- Accepting **minimal, structured input** from rehabilitation systems
- Validating that input against:
  - agreed-upon protocols
  - expected timelines
  - safety and plausibility constraints
- Producing **zero-knowledge proofs** that:
  - confirm progress or protocol adherence
  - can be verified by independent parties
  - do *not* expose underlying health data

This document is a conceptual placeholder for future collaboration with ZK specialists.

## Security & responsible disclosure

If you believe you have found a security or privacy issue in the conceptual design, please follow the process in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). Do not open public GitHub issues for sensitive topics.

## License

Unless otherwise stated inside individual files, documentation in this repository is provided under a permissive documentation license described in [LICENSE](LICENSE).

# Risk Disclosure – NeuroToken ZK Health System™

This repository explores concepts at the intersection of:

- Neuro-rehabilitation and long-term health support  
- Cryptography and zero-knowledge proofs  
- Incentive and token models  

These domains carry significant risk if misunderstood or misapplied.

## 1. Medical and clinical risk

- The documentation does not replace clinical guidelines, medical expertise or
  regulatory approvals.  
- Any future implementation must be evaluated and governed by qualified health
  professionals and ethics boards.  
- Misuse of incentive mechanisms in health contexts can harm vulnerable users.

## 2. Privacy and data-protection risk

- Health-related data is highly sensitive and subject to strict regulation
  (including GDPR in Europe).  
- Any implementation that touches real user data must perform a full
  data-protection impact assessment (DPIA) and follow local laws and guidance
  from supervisory authorities.  
- Zero-knowledge proofs reduce, but do not remove, privacy risks if the
  surrounding system is poorly designed.

## 3. Regulatory and financial risk

- Nothing here should be interpreted as legal, regulatory or investment advice.  
- Any real-world token or incentive structure may fall under financial
  regulation (for example MiCA in the EU, securities law in other regions).  
- It is the responsibility of any future implementer to obtain independent
  legal advice.

## 4. Technical and implementation risk

- The repository describes conceptual patterns, not audited or production-ready
  code.  
- Incorrect implementation of cryptographic protocols or incentive models can
  lead to loss of funds, privacy breaches or systemic failure.  

Use these materials as input to structured research, not as a blueprint for
deployment without thorough review and governance.

# Security and Responsible Disclosure

Even though this repository currently contains documentation only, the ideas
described here touch sensitive areas such as health data, cryptography and
financial incentives.

If you believe you have identified:

- A weakness in the proposed security or privacy model  
- A design that could lead to harmful misuse  
- A misinterpretation of regulatory requirements  

please notify the maintainers privately rather than opening a public issue.

Suggested process:

1. Prepare a short, factual description of the issue.  
2. Include which document and section you are referring to.  
3. Suggest, if possible, a safer alternative pattern or mitigation.
