# NeuroToken ZK Health System™ – Conceptual Repository

**Status:** Early conceptual / research stage  
**Environment:** Documentation only – no production code, no live patient data, no tokens issued.

This repository contains exploratory documentation for a privacy-preserving, outcome-oriented incentive framework for neuro-rehabilitation, built around:

- Zero-knowledge proof (ZK) mechanisms
- Separation of health data and token logic
- Strong governance, ethics and compliance by design

Nothing in this repository constitutes medical advice, investment advice, or a commitment to launch any financial instrument or token.
