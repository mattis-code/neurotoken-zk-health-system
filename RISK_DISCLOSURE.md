# Risk Disclosure – NeuroToken ZK Health System™

This repository explores concepts at the intersection of:

- Neuro-rehabilitation and long-term health support  
- Cryptography and zero-knowledge proofs  
- Incentive and token models  

These domains carry significant risk if misunderstood or misapplied.

## 1. Medical and clinical risk

- The documentation does not replace clinical guidelines, medical expertise or
  regulatory approvals.  
- Any future implementation must be evaluated and governed by qualified health
  professionals and ethics boards.  
- Misuse of incentive mechanisms in health contexts can harm vulnerable users.

## 2. Privacy and data-protection risk

- Health-related data is highly sensitive and subject to strict regulation
  (including GDPR in Europe).  
- Any implementation that touches real user data must perform a full
  data-protection impact assessment (DPIA) and follow local laws and guidance
  from supervisory authorities.  
- Zero-knowledge proofs reduce, but do not remove, privacy risks if the
  surrounding system is poorly designed.

## 3. Regulatory and financial risk

- Nothing here should be interpreted as legal, regulatory or investment advice.  
- Any real-world token or incentive structure may fall under financial
  regulation (for example MiCA in the EU, securities law in other regions).  
- It is the responsibility of any future implementer to obtain independent
  legal advice.

## 4. Technical and implementation risk

- The repository describes conceptual patterns, not audited or production-ready
  code.  
- Incorrect implementation of cryptographic protocols or incentive models can
  lead to loss of funds, privacy breaches or systemic failure.  

Use these materials as input to structured research, not as a blueprint for
deployment without thorough review and governance.
