# Brain Health Token™ (BHT)
## Satoshi-Grade Functional Utility Whitepaper — v1.0

### Abstract
Brain Health Token™ (BHT) is a cryptographically constrained, utility-bound digital instrument designed to activate non-clinical neuro-rehabilitation incentives.  
It operates under a strict zero-speculation model, uses deterministic issuance rules, and cannot be traded or speculated upon.  
BHT is not a currency. It is not a security.  
It is a **programmatic access-right**, activated only when a valid zero-knowledge “Recovery Proof” is submitted.

### 1. Introduction
Global neuro-rehabilitation lacks meaningful incentive systems.  
Today, progress is invisible, unrewarded, and economically unsupported.  
BHT introduces a verifiable, transparent mechanism where measurable improvement — without revealing any personal data — unlocks limited functional units (“access rights”) to platform services.

### 2. Purpose of BHT
BHT represents:
- Access to digital neuro-support tools  
- Participation rights in non-clinical rehabilitation programs  
- Tiered access to recovery analytics  
- Eligibility for BHBR-backed incentives  

BHT **cannot**:
- Be traded  
- Be exchanged for money  
- Be invested in  
- Be used as a speculative asset  

### 3. Issuance Logic
BHT follows three immutable principles:
1. **Proof-driven issuance:**  
   No token without zero-knowledge proof.
2. **Deterministic emission curve:**  
   Fixed issuance decay over time.
3. **Reserve protection:**  
   All issuance is constrained by BHBR’s provable Bitcoin reserve.

### 4. Privacy Architecture
All access to BHT is validated through:
- Local device computation  
- Zero-knowledge proofs  
- No identity exposure  
- No raw data sharing  
- No health logs or clinical metrics  
Only a single bit of information is required:  
**“Valid improvement occurred.”**

### 5. Functional Utility System
BHT grants rights to:
- Longitudinal goal tracking  
- Digital neuro-coaching modules  
- Cognitive support AI (non-clinical)  
- Resource matching  
- Deep-dive analytics (anonymized)  

All functionality resides on-chain or via transparent off-chain governance.

### 6. Integration with BHBR
Where BHBR is the **reserve backbone**,  
BHT is the **functional access layer**.  
A Recovery Proof triggers:
- Optional BHT issuance  
- Eligibility for BHBR-backed incentives  
- Updated anonymized progress state  

### 7. Governance
BHT governance is transparent and rule-bound:
- No discretionary minting  
- No privileged insiders  
- No hidden parameters  
- All issuance rules are public  

The system is intentionally simple — mirroring the design philosophy of early Bitcoin.

### 8. Non-Clinical Scope & Compliance
BHT is launched:
- Non-clinically  
- For behavioural and cognitive support  
- Without medical claims  
- Fully privacy-preserving  
- Fully transparent  
This avoids regulatory exposure while building global adoption.

### 9. Conclusion
BHT forms the incentive membrane between individual progress and the Bitcoin-backed BHBR reserve.  
It is not a speculative asset — it is a functional, cryptographically constrained utility primitive that enables the world’s first **Bitcoin-anchored neuro-rehabilitation economy**.
