# NeuroToken™ ZK Engine (Light Paper)
## Zero-Knowledge Progress Proof System — Public Technical Overview v1.0

### 1. Purpose
The ZK Engine enables users to prove rehabilitation progress without revealing:
- identity  
- health metrics  
- timestamps  
- biometric data  

Only a *proof of improvement* is exposed.

### 2. Pipeline
1. Local serialization  
2. Feature hashing  
3. ZK statement generation  
4. Proof envelope  
5. Engine verification  
6. Mint trigger (if BHBR/BHT integrated)  

### 3. Statements
Example:  
"User improved task consistency by X% within allowed time window."

### 4. Public Safety Constraints
- No circuit logic included  
- No proving keys  
- No constraints  
- No biometric models  

Only the architecture is described.

### 5. Why ZK?
- GDPR compatibility  
- Medical privacy protection  
- Scalable multi-region deployment  
- Cross-country compliance  

### 6. Behavior Model Integration
The proof engine integrates with:
- Orchestrator  
- Sync Engine  
- Aggregator  
- Token Model  

### 7. Multi-Platform Compatibility
- Python  
- JS  
- Local Mobile Runtime (2026)  

### 8. Roadmap Alignment
Full circuits appear only in the private, internal repo.
