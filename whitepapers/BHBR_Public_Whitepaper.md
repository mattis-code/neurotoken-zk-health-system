# Brain Health Bitcoin Reserve™ (BHBR)
## Public Monetary Architecture Whitepaper — v1.0

### 1. Purpose
BHBR is a non-custodial Bitcoin-backed reserve model designed to stabilize digital health economies without exposing users to volatility or custody risk. The reserve acts as a transparent, on-chain financial anchor for health-progress incentives, neuro-support systems, and rehabilitation ecosystems.

### 2. Architecture Summary
- 100% BTC-backed reserve state  
- Proof-of-Reserves (PoR) via deterministic snapshot hashing  
- Zero-knowledge progress proofs as mint triggers  
- Non-custodial treasury governance  
- Public auditability  

### 3. Why Bitcoin
Bitcoin provides:
- Immutable monetary base  
- Global liquidity  
- Predictable issuance  
- Censorship resistance  
- Transparent reserve validation  

### 4. Health Incentive Model
A patient’s rehabilitation progress is converted to a privacy-preserving proof.  
This proof validates:  
- The user is real  
- Progress is legitimate  
- No private health data is leaked  

Once validated, a micro-incentive is issued using BHT tokens.

### 5. Reserve Formula (Simplified)
Reserve_Value = BTC_Holdings × Oracle_Price  
Minting_Limit = Reserve_Value × Collateralization_Ratio  

### 6. Governance
BHBR follows a **Minimal Governance Framework**:
- Transparent BTC addresses  
- Automated validation  
- No manual distribution  
- No discretionary monetary issuance  

### 7. Security
- Multi-sig cold storage  
- ZK-based mint guards  
- Public monitoring layer  

### 8. Use Cases
- Rehabilitation adherence  
- Cognitive training incentivization  
- Health-behavior commitments  
- Non-clinical neuro-support reward systems  

### 9. Compliance
BHBR maintains no user data, no custody of funds, and no clinical functionality.
