# ZK-Light Engine™ — Zero-Knowledge Health Verification Layer  
### Public-Safe Edition (Full Content)

## Executive Summary
The ZK-Light Engine enables privacy-preserving health verification where a user can prove cognitive progress without revealing personal medical data. It is optimized for non-clinical neuro-support and real-time recovery feedback.

## Key Components
1. **Signal Aggregation**
   - Task performance  
   - Cognitive load indicators  
   - Behavioral metrics  
   - Response-time profiles  

2. **Feature Normalization**  
   Converts raw data into comparable cryptographic representations.

3. **Proof Generator**  
   Produces SNARK-friendly progress proofs.

4. **Verification Bridge**  
   Allows external systems (BHBR / BHT) to confirm validity.

## Privacy Guarantees
- No raw data leaves the device.  
- All proofs are unlinkable.  
- Complete GDPR alignment.  
- Compatible with federated health systems globally.

## System Advantages
- Ultra-low computational overhead  
- Proven scalability  
- Zero personal data leakage  
- Fraud-resistant architecture
