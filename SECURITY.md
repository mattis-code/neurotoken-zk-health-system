# Security and Responsible Disclosure

Even though this repository currently contains documentation only, the ideas
described here touch sensitive areas such as health data, cryptography and
financial incentives.

If you believe you have identified:

- A weakness in the proposed security or privacy model  
- A design that could lead to harmful misuse  
- A misinterpretation of regulatory requirements  

please notify the maintainers privately rather than opening a public issue.

Suggested process:

1. Prepare a short, factual description of the issue.  
2. Include which document and section you are referring to.  
3. Suggest, if possible, a safer alternative pattern or mitigation.

We do not offer bug-bounty payments at this stage, but we value and may publicly
acknowledge responsible, constructive feedback.
